<tr><td><h1>Linux Multilayer Switch</h1>
<p>This is the very heart of the LISA project. It consists of a kernel
module that performs layer 2 switching and implements virtual interfaces
for inter-vlan routing.
<p>We hope this will be integrated into the official Linux kernel someday,
but first our code must reach maturity and then we must prove the
kernel team that it's ok.
<p>This is not just a standalone module, but also a bunch of minor patches
for the kernel networking code. We had to hook into the packet reception
code. There's also a hook in the socket ioctl code to implement "deviceless"
ioctl's on sockets.
<p>This subproject also includes a user space tool to manage the various
features of the kernel module.
<h1>Downloads</h1>
<ul>
<li>Stable versions
 <ul>
 <li>None so far :(
 </ul>
<li>Version control system snapshots
 <ul>
 <li><a href="files/lms-snapshot-2005.04.16-1.tar.gz">2005, April 16</a> - Working
 virtual interfaces and inter-vlan routing; also does mac aging and static macs
 <li><u>2005, March 27</u> - Looks pretty stable; full layer 2 functionality except
 for mac aging and static macs
 <li><a href="files/lms-snapshot-2005.03.25-1.tar.gz">2005, March 25</a> - WARNING:
 This is very unstable and most likely you'll get a kernel panic
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>History</h1>
<ul>
<li>2005, March 23 - Working vlan database, forwarding database and
ioctl's
<li>2005, March 12 - The first changes in the kernel code and the first
lines of code that actually do something (besides the dummy "Hello world" :P)
<li>2005, February 27 - First entry in the version control system; a few
documentation and links files
</ul>
